code created and its output used for my thesis

To run the code you must first have the ROOT framework installed in your computer. (get it here --> https://root.cern.ch/ )

After you have installed ROOT, download the .C and .h files and the .root file.

1. Open a terminal in the folder you downloaded them and type root. (This starts ROOT)

2. Type .L filename.C+ and press enter.

3. Type filename("run15215_processed.root") and press enter.

Now just wait for the output to appear!
